The Fiscalini Law and Notary Office, Corso San Gottardo 16, 6830 Chiasso, is responsible for processing personal data in accordance with this statement.</p>

                        <p class="text-right">Some personal data are provided to us by you or by third parties involved in the course of telephone or email contacts in which you request our services. This may include the name, contact information, or information about the role the person plays within the company or organization for which you (or the respective contact person) work, or on whose behalf we are contacted. During the execution of the mandate, we also process personal data that we collect when corresponding with clients or third parties (in particular counterparties, authorities, courts, their respective employees, or other contact persons). This may include names, contact information, dates of birth, and/or information about employment relationships, income, family situation, or health status. We also collect certain personal data ourselves by retrieving them from public records or websites.</p>

                        <p class="text-right">To achieve these purposes, it may be necessary to transmit personal data to the following categories of recipients: external service providers, customers, counterparties and their legal representatives, business partners with whom we may need to coordinate legal services, as well as authorities and courts.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p class="text-right">We process personal data within our sphere of responsibility in Switzerland and, if applicable, in the EU/EEA. We may also transfer this data to recipients (in particular customers, counterparties or authorities) who process personal data in other countries, even if these countries do not guarantee a level of protection comparable to Swiss law. In the latter case, we will only do so on the basis of consent or standard contractual clauses. The same applies if the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract or to assert legal claims.</p>

We take appropriate and proportionate measures to protect personal data against loss, unauthorized modification, or unlawful access by third parties. If you provide us with personal data through third parties (for example, your employees or other contact persons), it is your responsibility to inform them in a comprehensive manner about the data processing carried out by our law firm and other legal or external service providers (for example, in a data protection statement intended for your employees).</p>

                        <p class="text-right">We draw your attention to the fact that, in order to execute the mandate, we turn to external IT service providers or cloud service providers with servers in Switzerland. In these cases, we use some IT services or means of communication that may pose risks to data security (for example, email and video conferencing). If you would like us to take special security measures, please let us know.</p>

                        <p class="text-right">The above-mentioned purposes are based on a legitimate interest in processing personal data. Some processing is also necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you. The same applies to the legal obligations to which we are subject, for example, the obligation to retain documents.</p>

These individuals also have the right to transmit or transfer their data. However, these rights are subject to conditions and exceptions. To the extent that the law authorizes or requires it, some requests may be denied. Therefore, we may or may need to retain personal data or continue to process them in another way for legal reasons, despite a request to delete or limit the processing of data.</p>
